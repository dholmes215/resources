# Contribution Guidelines

## Adding a new language

A language's section should follow this format, as a second level heading and
below:

## Subject
*Description*
### Learning
* [Price emoji]\[Medium emoji] Thing 1 &mdash; Short description of Thing 1.
* [Price emoji]\[Medium emoji] Thing 2 &mdash; Short description of Thing 2.
### Culture
* [Price emoji]\[Medium emoji] Thing 3 &mdash; Short description of Thing 3.

Those are `&mdash;` 

Note that every description must end in some sort of punctuation. 

Learning resources include documentation and tutorials for direct learning.

Culture resources are resources that are important to that language's ecosystem,
such as a popular speaker within its community or common guidelines for
efficient style.

## Adding a new first level heading

This list is general, so it welcomes the addition of new sections, but just keep
in mind that a first level heading should be able to support many second level
heading topics.
